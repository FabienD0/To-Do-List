# To-Do List

This is my version of the famous To-Do list application. In addition to being my first full-stack project, this was also my first time using Typescript & Next.js. I learned so much and am happy with the result. For the backend, mongoDB is used when the user logs in. Everything is saved with Window local storage if there is no user.
